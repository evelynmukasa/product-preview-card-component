## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I dived more deeply into css positionning properties using grid system and flexbox,moreover i learned how to change img src attribute on a breakpoint in css stylesheet.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
 .itemImg img{
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
        content: url(images/image-product-desktop.jpg);
     }
```

### Continued development

On my next challenge i would like to set up an entire page layout .
